    "When faced with probabilistic data generated through samples, users finds it difficult to know which x-axis values are most likely to be representative, as the distributions of each category is different and confidence levels overlap. <br />\n",
    "As such, it is proposed to allow users to indicate the y-axis value of interest (e.g. 42,000) and then draw a horizontal line and color bars based on this value. So bars might be colored red if they are definitely above this value (given the confidence interval), blue if they are definitely below this value, or white if they contain this value. <br />\n",
